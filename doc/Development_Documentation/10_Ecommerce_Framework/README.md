# E-Commerce Framework

## Why Pimcore E-Commerce Framework
The e-commerce environment has fundamentally changed and e-commerce projects often face challenges like these: 
 - complex product structures
 - complex pricing structures
 - complex availability calculations
 - thousands customer groups with
   - customer group specific prices
   - customer group specific assortments
 - individual checkouts
 - individual design
 - highly agile projects with changing requirements
 - etc. 
 
We think for these challenges a default shop system that pops out of a box, that has fixed product data model and 
workflows and a template based frontend and needs to be connected and integrated with other systems via interfaces 
is not the tool to go. 

We think for these challanges you need...
- a framework for developers to build outstanding e-commerce solutions for customers
- with a native integration into Pimcore
- with a component based architecture
- and a strict separation between backend functionality and frontend presentation. 

That is the idea behind the E-Commerce Framework of Pimcore. Like Pimcore it self it is not a ready made system,
it is a set of tools and functionality to help building e-commerce applications really fast and flexible.
